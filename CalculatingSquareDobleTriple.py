number = int(input("type a number\n"))
double = number * 2
triple = number * 3
root_square = number ** (1/2) #where ** its the power of a number
print(f'The double of the number is {double}\nthe triple is {triple} and square root is {root_square}')

###I can solve in another way
n = int(input("type a number\n"))
print(f'The double of the number is {n * 2}.')
print(f'the triple is {n * 3}\n and square root is {n ** (1/2)}')
